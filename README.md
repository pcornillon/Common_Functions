Project: Common_Functions

This project has a number, well a lot, of functions used by a broad range of my projects. In addition to functions I have written, it has functions, actually packages of other functions, written by others. 

Make sure that if you reference this project in a publication, that you are careful to attribute properly to packages written by others. Hopefully, there is a README file in these packages saying how to do this.
